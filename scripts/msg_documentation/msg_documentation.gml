Dynamic Pop-up Text Box (by matharoo)
------------------------------------

--About--

These are pop-up text boxes that show up above your object depending on the condition you set.
There are three different text boxes here:

Dynamic Text Box: This one comes with a typewriter effect, where each letter appears one-by-one.
Multi-Dynamic Text Box: Same as the first one, but takes an array containing multiple messages that appear one-by-one when you press a key.
Static Text Box: Without typewriter effect, text comes up instantly.

The scripts are commented. Feel free to tweak them.

--Usage--
Use these scripts in the Draw event of the object you want to show the message above.
Functions like draw_set_font(), draw_set_color() etc. may be used to change the appearance, but changing the text alignment would only mess things up.
The correct alignments for these scripts are:

Horizontal: Left
Vertical: Top

If your text alignment is different**, use this code in the same Draw event as the script call, and before it:
draw_set_halign(fa_left);
draw_set_valign(fa_top);

**You can know that it's your text alignment causing a problem when the text appears out of the box.

-------------------------
Dynamic Text Box - Usage:
-------------------------

Draw event:

if (condition*)
{
	msg_dynamic("Your message here", speed_key_optional);
}
else
{
	msg_stop();
}

speed_key_optional: As it says, this argument is completely optional. It is used to speed up the text. So say if you want to speed it up
					when you hold Shift, type "vk_shift" into the argument. You can also use ord().

Note: If you want the typewriter effect to show up only once (which is the first time the player opens the message), remove the else part.

-------------------------
Multi-Dynamic Text Box - Usage:
-------------------------

Draw event:

if (condition*)
{
	msg_dynamic_multi(array, key);
}
else
{
	msg_stop();
}

array: It should be a simple array with more than one message in it. Just type the array name without any [square brackets].
condition: It is the key that moves the dialogue to the next message in the array (if there is one), only when the current message has
			been completely shown. So say if you want to move to the next message on pressing enter, type "vk_enter" into
			that argument. This key will also be used to speed up the text when you hold it. You can also use ord().

------------------------
Static Text Box - Usage:
------------------------

Draw event:

if (condition*)
{
	msg_static("Your message here");
}

-----
Note:
-----

*The condition should be for when you want the message to show up. So say you want the message to show up on mouse hover:
    if (position_meeting(mouse_x, mouse_y, id))
	{
		msg_static("Access help menu");
	}
	
-----------------------
Using a different sprite:
-----------------------

The functionality of using a different sprite for the text box has been added in version 1.2.

Here's how you do it in the following functions:

--msg_dynamic--

The arguments for the functions are:

	msg_dynamic(text, key, grid_sprite, arrow_sprite);
	
The last three arguments are optional. In the sprite arguments, you have to specify the sprites being used for the textbox grid and the arrow.
To specify the last two arguments, you also have to fill in the "key" argument. But if you don't want any key for the message, use -1 there.

--msg_dynamic_multi--

Arguments:

	msg_dynamic_multi(text, key, grid_sprite, arrow_sprite, more_sprite);
	
The last three arguments are optional, and they are for the sprites.

--msg_static--

	msg_static(text, grid_sprite, arrow_sprite);
	
Same as msg_dynamic. Last two arguments are optional, and for the sprites.

--------
Example:
--------

Say you want to use one of the extra textboxes I have provided in the asset. So for using the sprites in the folder that says "1 - 48x48" with the function "msg_dynamic_multi", you would do this:

msg_dynamic_multi("message", vk_key, spr_msg_grid1, spr_msg_arrow1, spr_msg_more1);

It's that simple. You just have to tell the function which sprites you want to use, and it works.

How to create/use new sprites:
------------------------------

It is hard to explain, so if you want to create new sprites for your textbox, please contact me, I will help you personally.
You can also contact me if you're having any trouble in using this asset.
